# Firefox GNOME theme

<br>

**A GNOME theme for Firefox**

This theme follows latest GNOME Adwaita style. Personal fork of [rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme).

Changes from upstream:

- Fixed urlbar go-button icon not applying (now uses `content` instead of `list-style-image`, matching how Firefox renders it as a plain `<img>`)
- Fixed urlbar icons (go-button, page-action icons, search-revert button) being stretched/distorted; forced to a fixed 16x16 size
- Hid the "search with" one-offs section in the urlbar dropdown
- Hid the "Sign in to sync" promo card in the app menu
- Removed the tab close-button hover overlay
- Reworked tab-label text fade/mask on hover/selection to match the overlay removal
- Defined the missing `--gnome-content-padding` variable (12px), fixing zero padding/margins in notification popups (e.g. extension install buttons flush against the edge), the sidebar panel header and the trust panel
- Matched notification popup body padding (top/sides) to the 12px footer margin so spacing is even on all edges
- Hid the icon-only private browsing indicator button (shown when `browser.nova.enabled` is set), which kept an empty tab bar visible in private windows with a single hidden tab

### Omarchy

The `omarchy` branch adapts the theme to [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) 4:

- Colors follow the active Omarchy theme. `omarchy/firefox.css.tpl` is an Omarchy template, so `omarchy theme set` renders the theme's `colors.toml` to `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/firefox.css`, which is linked into the profile as `theme/omarchy/generated.css`. Without it, a Gruvbox palette is used.
- Square corners everywhere.
- The UI uses the Omarchy font (fontconfig's `monospace`, which `omarchy font set` changes; JetBrains Mono by default).
- No window buttons, since Hyprland manages the window.

Install with `./scripts/omarchy-install.sh` (same options as `install.sh`). Firefox only reads its CSS at startup, so restart it after switching Omarchy themes.

> [!WARNING]
> This theme might do things that are not supported by upstream Firefox. If you face an issue, test if it is reproducible in vanilla Firefox.

## Description

This is a bunch of CSS code to make Firefox look closer to GNOME's native apps.


### Firefox versions support

The `master` branch of this repo supports the current Firefox stable release `157`.


## Installation scripts

1. Clone this repo and enter folder:

	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/chayotesudado/firefox-gnome-theme-personal.git
	cd firefox-gnome-theme-personal
	```

### Auto install script

This script will look for Firefox profiles from various known locations (`~/.mozilla/firefox/`, Flatpak, Snap, etc) and install the theme in each one.

You can execute it by running:

```sh
./scripts/auto-install.sh
```

### Manual install script

This script will only install the theme into the profiles found in the default Firefox folder `~/.mozilla/firefox/`. The script accepts various flags to change its behavior.

Here are some examples of how to use it:

```sh
./scripts/install.sh # Standard
./scripts/install.sh -p pc8577yz.default-release # Only install in a profile named pc8577yz.default-release
./scripts/install.sh -f ~/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/.mozilla/firefox # Flatpak
./scripts/install.sh -f ~/snap/firefox/common/.mozilla/firefox #Snap
```

#### Script options
- `-f <firefox_folder_path>` *optional*
	- Set custom Firefox folder path, for example `~/.mozilla/icecat/`.
	- Default: `~/.mozilla/firefox/`

- `-p <profile_name>` *optional*
	- Set custom profile name, for example `e0j6yb0p.default-nightly`.
	- Default: All the profiles found in the firefox folder

## Required Firefox preferences
We provide a **user.js** configuration file in `configuration/user.js` that enables some preferences required by this theme to work.

You should already have this file installed if you followed one of the installation methods, but in any case be sure this preferences are enabled under `about:config`:

- `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`

	This preference is required to load the custom CSS in Firefox, otherwise the theme wouldn't work.

- `svg.context-properties.content.enabled`

	This preference is required to recolor the icons, otherwise you will get black icons everywhere.

> For other non essential preferences checkout `configuration/user.js`.

## Updating

You can follow the installation script steps again to update the theme.

## Uninstalling
1. Go to your profile folder. (Go to `about:support` in Firefox > Application Basics > Profile Directory > Open Directory)
2. Remove `chrome` folder.
3. Remove the unwanted preferences from your `user.js` inside your profile folder. The install script append the needed prefs in that file, you can check what preferences does it append by checking `configuration/user.js` in this repo.

## Enabling optional features
Optional features can be enabled by creating new `boolean` preferences in `about:config`.

1. Go to the `about:config` page
2. Type the key of the feature you want to enable
3. Set it as a `boolean` and click on the add button
4. Restart Firefox

### Features

- **Hide single tab** `gnomeTheme.hideSingleTab`

	Hide the tab bar when only one tab is open.

	> **Note:** You should move the new tab button out of the tabbar or it will be hidden when there is only one tab. You can rearrange the toolbars doing a right-click on any toolbar and selecting "Customize Toolbar…".

- **Normal width tabs** `gnomeTheme.normalWidthTabs`

	Use normal width tabs as default Firefox.

- **Close only selected tabs** `gnomeTheme.closeOnlySelectedTabs`

	Show the close button on the selected tab only.

	> **Note:** This feature has a [known color bug](#icons-color-broken-with-system-icons).


- **No themed Icons** `gnomeTheme.noThemedIcons`

	Use default Firefox icons instead of the included icons.


- **Symbolic tab icons** `gnomeTheme.symbolicTabIcons`

	Make all tab icons look kinda like symbolic icons.

	Show a blank page instead of the "You're off the record" intro when opening a private window.

- **Hide unified extensions button** `gnomeTheme.hideUnifiedExtensions`

	Hide unified extensions button from the navbar, you can also use `extensions.unifiedExtensions.enabled` instead, which is only going to work till Firefox 111.

- **Drag window from headerbar buttons** `gnomeTheme.dragWindowHeaderbarButtons`

	Allow dragging the window from headerbar buttons.

	> **Note:** This feature is BUGGED. It can activate the button with unpleasant behavior.

- **Tabs as headerbar** `gnomeTheme.tabsAsHeaderbar`

	Place the tabs on the top of the window, and use the tabs bar to hold the window controls, like Firefox's standard tab bar.
	
	> **Note:** Enabling with `gnomeTheme.hideSingleTab` will replace the single tab with a title bar.

- **OLED black theme** `gnomeTheme.oledBlack`

	Change the dark theme into the black variant.
	
- **Show "List All Tabs" button on overflow** `gnomeTheme.allTabsButtonOnOverflow`

	Show the `List All Tabs` button when the tabs bar is overflowing (when you have too many tabs that the width of the tabs no longer shrinks when new tabs are added).

- **Show "List All Tabs" button** `gnomeTheme.allTabsButton`

	Show the `List All Tabs` button all the time, like stock Firefox.

	Align the tab title and favicon to left of tab in place of center.
	
- **Bookmarks bar in fullscreen** `gnomeTheme.bookmarksOnFullscreen`

	 Show the bookmarks bar while in fullscreen.

### Extensions support

We also have optional features to enable support for some Firefox extensions.

> [!WARNING]
> Note that extension support is maintained by the community, so requests to support new extensions are not allowed, and the included extensions may be broken until someone shows up to fix them.

- **Adaptive Tab Bar Colour support** `gnomeTheme.extensions.adaptiveTabBarColour`

	> **Note:** Adaptive Tab Bar Colour presently hard-codes the colours for the home page (both normal as well as private windows). When navigating from the home page to any other page, the colour of the UI might momentarily switch to the original firefox home page colour before switching back to the expected colour (this is especially noticeable in private windows). This only happens when navigating from the homepage to another page, subsequent navigations should be unaffected.
	
## Known bugs

### CSD have sharp corners
See upstream [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408360).

#### Wayland fix:
1. Go to the `about:config` page
2. Search for the `layers.acceleration.force-enabled` preference and set it to true.
3. Now restart Firefox, and it should look good!

#### X11 fix:
1. Go to the `about:config` page
2. Type `mozilla.widget.use-argb-visuals`
3. Set it as a `boolean` and click on the add button
4. Now restart Firefox, and it should look good!

### Icons color broken with System icons
Icons might appear black where they should be white on some systems. I have no idea why, but you can adjust them directly in the `system-icons.css` file, look for `--gnome-icons-hack-filter` & `--gnome-window-icons-hack-filter` vars and play with css filters.

## Development

If you wanna mess around the styles and change something, you might find these
things useful.

To use the Inspector to debug the UI, open the developer tools (F12) on any
page, go to options, check both of those:

- Enable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes
- Enable remote debugging

Now you can close those tools and press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I to Inspect the browser
UI.

Also you can inspect any GTK3 application, for example type this into a terminal
and it will run Epiphany with the GTK Inspector, so you can check the CSS styles
of its elements too.

```sh
GTK_DEBUG=interactive epiphany
```
